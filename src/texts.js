const intro = "In the current state of melting modernity, humanity barely floats. Through mechanisms of constant resignification, language co-opts life itself. Narration is liquefied while the crumbling image of the nation state is contested by rising waters. Through an increasing tide of the ocean’s appearance in contemporary art projects, liquid fiction has come to encompass a changing social sphere. But although the waters are wet, drying might not be the solution. In the circular movement of the wave, neo-colonial regimes are contested by a circular dialectics of time. With the crest of the wave, a caesura follows, that inverts the perspective of what floats.<br/>’It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.’ Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used these words to describe the global market in the 1848 Communist Manifesto. Approaching two centuries later, they are still accurate: “The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe.“ The entire surface of the globe is covered by what Marx and Engels called “fast-frozen relations“, building up and melting, moving in a constant flux, but never settling down---when all resources are gone, only time matters. In his book *Liquid Modernity* (2000), Zygmunt Bauman locates a permanent feature of modernity in ’melting solids’ - “at the present time, the time of fluid modernity“^.^Bauman’s point derives from Marx’s and Engels’ famous line “all that is solid melts into air“^,^ used to describe the materiality of the constant machine of innovation.But what happens when the globe’s surface decreases due to rising waters, when there is no more fluid matter to freeze and reshape ? This is when we have to direct our gazes toward the oceans, as we once did toward the surfaces of neighboring planets.The waves of melting glaciers are continuously licking the shores of our continents, reminding us that the oceans are liquid by nature.Liquid modernity depends on these waters, just like the first civilizations once depended on rivers.Throughout the centuries, humans have transported goods and workforces, colonized land and dumped waste into the lungs of the earth.Today, it isn’t only ice that melts.In a global market economy, the nation state itself is being liquidated.Currencies stream between multinational organizations and nationalist narratives float through disintegrating letters of wet paper.";
